---------------------------

	* 	This command is implemented as a structure named Hist
		of type 
			struct hist{
    			char *hname;
				char  hdt[50];
				int hstat;
			}histarr[11];
													
	* 	It stores the name of the command inside hname, its time and date inside hdt and its status in hstat.
	
	*   Time is retrived using time_t data structure which has all the fields like day, month, year, hours, minutes, seconds .....
		When a command is recieved , immediately its time stamp is pushed along with its name to the hist structure.
