HOW PWD USER CREATED COMMAND WORKS INTERNALLY
---------------------------------------------

	* PWD internally calls getcwd() system call.
	
	* It is of type char *getcwd(char *buf, size_t size);
	
	* Here the current directory path is stored in "buf" which is a pointer to character 
	  and "size" is used to store the length of the string which is pointed by buf.
