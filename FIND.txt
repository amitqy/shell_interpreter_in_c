  FIND.txt, new3.c, new.c, README, CD.txt, final.c, new2.c, new4.c, PWD.txt, time

HOW "FIND" WORKS INTERNALLY
---------------------------

* FIND()  is implemented with the help of  "struct dirent" which is a directory data structure 
  which holds all the attributes of its files and directories.

* FIND() also uses strncmp(), which is used to match a part of string with another string, 
  returns true if it matches partly, else it returns false.
